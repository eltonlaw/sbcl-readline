sbcl-readline 1.0.1:

	Keep multiline command as a single entry in the history.

sbcl-readline 1.0.2:

	Provide proper autocompletion for keyword arguments in case of a function with both &rest and &key arguments.
	Handle SBCL's &more keyword properly.
	Do not miss documentation strings when help is printed on the TAB key being hit twice.

sbcl-readline 1.0.3:

	Separate completion logic from GNU Readline specific things. This
	change makes it possible to use sbcl-readline for something else but
	REPL. However, it hasn't been tested much.

	Provide Unicode support.
